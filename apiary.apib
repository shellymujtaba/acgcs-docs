#Cloud Services V2 API
This is version 2 of ACG cloud services api's. If you are looking for older version 1 - please refer to https://confluence.123dapp.com/display/ADSK/Marketplace+APIs

#URL
URL Structure is `https://{domain}/api/{version}/{resource}/{resourceId}`    
All endpoints begin with /api/{version}/

Production URL: https://www.123dapp.com/api/v2  
Beta URL: https://beta.squidplatform.com/api/v2  
Example: https://beta.squidplatform.com/assets/123456 

#Verbs
We use restful verbs.

|Verb         | Description                                                                                               
| ------      | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `GET`       |  Used to select one or more items. Success returns 200 status code with json result item(s) in body.   
| `POST`      |  Used to create a new item. Success returns 201 status code with newly created json item in body.      
| `PUT`       |  Used to update an item. Success returns 200 status code with updated json item in body.               
| `DELETE`    |  Used to delete an item. Success returns 204 status code with no body.

#Status Codes
We'll respond with one of the following status codes.

|Code       | Description 
| ------    |---------
|`200`       | Success  
|`201`        | Success - new resource created.
|`204`        | Success - no content to return.
|`302`        | Redirect  to another resource
|`400`        | Bad Request - i.e. your request couldn't be parsed.
|`401`        | Unauthorized - user is not logged in, cannot access resource.
|`404`        | Not Found - resource doesn't exist.
|`422`        | Unprocessable Entity - i.e. validation errors.
|`429`        | Rate limit exceeded, try again later.
|`500`        | Server error.

#Errors
Any 4xx and 5xx response is an error. 
In addition to the http code we will return additional information in the response payload as follows:  

    {
        "code":"numeric code specific to this api as defined in docs",  
        "status":"same as http status code e.g 404",  
        "message":"human readable error message",
        "error_id":"unique code which links back to stack trace in logs",
        "data":"any additional data the api may want to send back as json"
    }


#Headers
All api calls require the following headers:  

**X-Session**: A guest or member session. See Auth section on how to generate a guest/member session. Access to various api's depends on the type of session. 
For example - guest session will provide access to ready only public api's such as /assets. While member session will provide access to write apis and also extended information for /member api.  

**X-AFC**: Unique identifier assigned to your enendiceslication. It is very important to use the AFC assigned to your application and not re-use AFC's across apps as this creates issues in debugging and analytics.  
**X-Secure-Session**: Secure session is required for certain api calls which require updates to member profile or ecommerce transactions. Secure session have a shorter life span (6 hrs). So in case an api returns 401 (unauthorized) response code - the applicaiton should prompt user to log in again.  
#Standards
During api creation we follow these standards: -
 1. All json key names are lower case.
 2. Multi word names are seperated by _ e.g member_id, asset_id etc.  
 3. For api's that return paged result we always return count, limit (page size) and offset (current cursor location) values.  
 4. For api's that return paged result we always return _link_prev and _link_next values.  
 5. All times are in GMT with format "April 09, 2011 07:27:54"
 6. All api end points strive to be nouns vs verbs. The http method (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) determines the action to be performed e.g GET /api/v1/asset vs /api/v1/get_asset.

#Group Assets
An asset is the top level storage construct for cloud services. An asset can be thought of as a project or a folder with metadata. The asset contains 1..n files, metadata elements and references to other assets or even external links. 
Within the 3d modeling/printing eco-system it is often hard to model a complete creation and workflow with a single file (for example: a model may consist of obj, mtl, texture files) - Asset provides an aggregation point for several related files and metadata elements to fully represent a creation, its various transformations, translations and references. 
The operations listed below provide a full set of activities which can be performed against an asset. 

##Asset [/assets/{id}]
Operations to perform CRUD operations on an asset with basic metadata. Additional operation sets will populate this asset with constituent files, additional metadata etc.

# Group Files
Files are "second class" citizens in the Cloud Services ecosystem. As explained in the Assets api introduction: Within the 3d modeling/printing eco-system it is often hard to model a complete creation and workflow with a single file. Hence a file by itself has little meaning without the context of the asset it belongs to. 
Of course in order to add a file to an asset, it must be uploaded first. The api operations below provide various ways of uploading a file and recieving a file id which can then be used to associate file with an asset. 

##Upload Server [/server/upload]
The API to get the upload server for uploading the files
### Upload server [GET]
+ Request (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

+ Response 200

            {

            }

#Upload File [/files/upload]
If the file is sent as a application/gzip and unzip parameter is = true, it will be unzipped and id will be returned for each constituent file within the zip. 
In case of gzipped files, file name extension will be utilized to determine the file type (e.g. stl or obj). 
In case of base64 encoded files, file name extension will be utilized to determine file type (e.g stl or obj).

Note: Please use the server for the file upload received from the upload server API.

+ Parameters
    + unzip (optional,String, `false`)...Indicate if the zip file should be unzipped and each constituent files be treated as an individual file. Default is false.

# Group Auth

## Login [/login]
Authorization is done through an "oauth-like" 3 legged process for web applications and a slightly modified 2 legged process for desktop/mobile apps.  
Here are the general steps:  
1. Client application calls the /login end point to begin login workflow  
2. The /login end point displays the login screen based on display criteria specified by the client  
3. Once end user has logged in the end point redirects back to the relative_redirect_path specified by the client application along with a login token  
4. The client application passes the token along with the login secret key to the /login/authenticatetoken end point to recieve a user session

#Group Carts
Cart is nothing but a shopping basket where user can put digital or physical items.
Here are some key points about cart:
* Cart is created for guest user as well as for login user.
* Cart is of type ESTORE or MARKETPLACE.
* Cart is different for each <a href="/reference/appendices">ECommerceAffiliates</a>.
Exp: Sketchbook, Pixlr and Ciruits are under different <a href="/reference/appendices">ECommerceAffiliates</a> so for single user there will be different carts for each of these apps.
* Cart can be different for each affiliate code (X-AFC in header). Please contact cloud service team if affiliate code specific cart is needed.
