# Cloud Services V2 API
This is version 2 of ACG cloud services api's. If you are looking for older version 1 - please refer to https://confluence.123dapp.com/display/ADSK/Marketplace+APIs

# URL For Login
For login specifically use following end points. These end points are served from your nearest edge cache location and minimize load times for login dialogs:
Production: https://accounts.acg.autodesk.com/api/v2/login  
Beta: https://beta-accounts.acg.autodesk.com/api/v2/login

# URL For API
URL Structure is `https://{domain}/api/{version}/{resource}/{resourceId}`    
All endpoints begin with /api/{version}/

_Production URL_: https://api.acg.autodesk.com/api/v2 <br>
_Beta URL_: https://beta-api.acg.autodesk.com/api/v2 <br>
Example: https://beta-api.acg.autodesk.com/api/v2/assets/123456

# Verbs
We use restful verbs.

|Verb         | Description                                                                                               
| ------      | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `GET`       |  Used to select one or more items. Success returns 200 status code with json result item(s) in body.   
| `POST`      |  Used to create a new item. Success returns 201 status code with newly created json item in body.      
| `PUT`       |  Used to update an item. Success returns 200 status code with updated json item in body.               
| `DELETE`    |  Used to delete an item. Success returns 204 status code with no body.

# Status Codes
We'll respond with one of the following status codes.

|Code       | Description 
| ------    |---------
|`200`       | Success  
|`201`        | Success - new resource created.
|`204`        | Success - no content to return.
|`302`        | Redirect  to another resource
|`400`        | Bad Request - i.e. your request couldn't be parsed.
|`401`        | Unauthorized - user is not logged in, cannot access resource.
|`404`        | Not Found - resource doesn't exist.
|`422`        | Unprocessable Entity - i.e. validation errors.
|`429`        | Rate limit exceeded, try again later.
|`500`        | Server error. There is nothing the app or user can do to recover from this. Correct response is to contact ACS for 500 errors. 

# Errors
Any 4xx and 5xx response is an error. 
In addition to the http code we will return additional information in the response payload as follows:  

    {
        "code":"numeric code specific to this api as defined in docs",  
        "status":"same as http status code e.g 404",  
        "message":"human readable error message",
        "error_id":"unique code which links back to stack trace in logs",
        "data":"any additional data the api may want to send back as json"
    }


# Headers
All api calls require the following headers:  

**X-Session**: A guest or member session. See Auth section on how to generate a guest/member session. Access to various api's depends on the type of session. 
For example - guest session will provide access to ready only public api's such as /assets. While member session will provide access to write apis and also Extend members subscription by specified period.information for /member api.  

**X-AFC**: Unique identifier assigned to your enendiceslication. It is very important to use the AFC assigned to your application and not re-use AFC's across apps as this creates issues in debugging and analytics.  
**X-Secure-Session**: Secure session is required for certain api calls which require updates to member profile or ecommerce transactions. **Secure session have a shorter life span (6 hrs). So in case an api returns 401 (unauthorized) response code - the applicaiton should prompt user to log in again**.  
# Standards
During api creation we follow these standards: -
 1. All json key names are lower case.
 2. Multi word names are seperated by _ e.g member_id, asset_id etc.  
 3. For api's that return paged result we always return count, limit (page size) and offset (current cursor location) values.  
 4. For api's that return paged result we always return _link_prev and _link_next values.  
 5. All times are in GMT with format "April 09, 2011 07:27:54"
 6. All api end points strive to be nouns vs verbs. The http method (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) determines the action to be performed e.g GET /api/v1/asset vs /api/v1/get_asset.

#Group Assets
An asset is the top level storage construct for cloud services. An asset can be thought of as a project or a folder with metadata. The asset contains 1..n files, metadata elements and references to other assets or even external links. 
Within the 3d modeling/printing eco-system it is often hard to model a complete creation and workflow with a single file (for example: a model may consist of obj, mtl, texture files) - Asset provides an aggregation point for several related files and metadata elements to fully represent a creation, its various transformations, translations and references. 
The operations listed below provide a full set of activities which can be performed against an asset. 

**Hash based API calls**

All the Assets API below can also be invoked by passing the hash value as a param for authentication.

_Dispatching the request:_
* Use the guest session when calling the the API.
* Pass timestamp parameter as "ts". Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. The timestamp should be within past 15 mins timeframe.
* Pass hash parameter as "hash". This is generated using SHA-256 hash function combining Affiliate Code + Asset Id + Timestamp + Affiliate shared secret

**_Note_**: For Asset creation POST API, please use Member Id (Asset owner) instead of Asset Id for generating the hash value.

**Asset Status**

Assets can have different status. The below table displays all the possible status values.

|_Status_|_Value_
|----|----
|Public|0|
|Private|2|
|Deleted|1|

## Asset [/assets/{id}{?asset_name,description,tags,media_type_id,software,publish,progress_status,parent_asset_id,referenced_assets,extended_data,version,asset_ids,license_id,asset_taxonomy,language,region}]
Operations to perform CRUD operations on an asset with basic metadata. Additional operation sets will populate this asset with constituent files, additional metadata etc.

# Group Files
Files are "second class" citizens in the Cloud Services ecosystem. As explained in the Assets api introduction: Within the 3d modeling/printing eco-system it is often hard to model a complete creation and workflow with a single file. Hence a file by itself has little meaning without the context of the asset it belongs to. 
Of course in order to add a file to an asset, it must be uploaded first. The api operations below provide various ways of uploading a file and recieving a file id which can then be used to associate file with an asset. 

## Upload Server [/server/upload]
The API to get the upload server for uploading the files
### Upload server [GET]
+ Request (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

+ Response 200

        {
            "server": "storagealpha.squidplatform.com"
        }

## Upload File [/files/upload{?unzip,fileurl,filename,public,software}]
If the file is sent as a application/gzip and unzip parameter is = true, it will be unzipped and id will be returned for each constituent file within the zip. 
In case of gzipped files, file name extension will be utilized to determine the file type (e.g. stl or obj). 
In case of base64 encoded files, file name extension will be utilized to determine file type (e.g stl or obj).

+ Parameters
    + unzip (optional,String, `false`)...Indicate if the zip file should be unzipped and each constituent files be treated as an individual file. Default is false.
    + fileurl (optional,String, `http://xxxxxx.com/file`)...URL of the file from where the file need to be retrived.(only works when filename parameteris passed alongwith)
    + filename (optional,String, `filename.jpg`)...name of the downloaded file from fileurl. <br/> **_Note:_** filename param is effective only if the file is uploaded using fileurl param
    + public (optional,String, `false`)...Indicate if the file should have URL which can be accessed without restrictions. Default is false.
    + software (optional,Number, `31`)...Indicate the Application used to upload file.

## Search [/members/search{?name,description,limit,offset,sort_by,sort_order}]
This operation will return a list of members.  At least one parameter is required.

**Search Rules:**
* Searches are case insensitive and match full or partial words for each search term in any order: Searching for "name=dav MIT” would return names such as "Dave Smith”, "david mitchell”, “Mitch Davis”, or “DAVY”.
* Multiple search terms can be separated with spaces, for example "name=dave smith".  By default multiple terms generate an "OR" condition so "name=dave smith" returns names containing _either_ dave _or_ smith.
* Enter AND to combine terms as in "name=dave AND smith", which returns only names containing _all_ terms. 
* If you search by both parameters (name and description), only members who meet both search conditions (AND) will be returned.

## Update Card [/members/{memberId}/updatecards{?product_id,new_product_id,encrypted_credit_card,encrypted_cvv,exp_month,exp_year,name,phone,card_type,card_last_four_digit,store_type}] 

This API will return you a link which you can embed in an iframe. There are different cases where you can use this API as mentioned below:-

Make note that you will pass AFC, Session and SecureSession to API as header as usual. This API will create a link from the parameters provided by you.

A) User buys a subscription (non appstore subscription) and want to attach a new card to the subscription.

Example scenario:-

1. User buys a subscription of $9 for a month with card 4111 1111 1111 1111.
2. User's autorenew is true so at the end of a month above card will get charge with recurring price of $9.
3. But above card is going to expire in mid of the month OR user wants recurring charges to be charged on another card. So user will go for update card.
   
Pass current product id to which user has subscribed.

B) User wants to add card for future transactions like buying a new subscription or physical products

Example scenario:-

1. User buys a subscription of $9 for a month with card 4111 1111 1111 1111.
2. User want to add card for future transaction like to buy physical product.
3. Make note that once user uses card for a transaction it will get attached to that user and you can use that card for next transaction without entering card details. You can get all link cards with GET Member/CreditCards
   
Pass product_id as 0; so that card will not be attached to subscription but will just get added.

C) User buys appstore subscription (non appstore subscription) and try to upgrade

Example scenario:-

   1. User buys a month non-true subscription through appstore.
   2. User wants to upgrade to 1-year subscription. Make not that card is not attached to users profile as subscription is coming form appstore.
   3. App will call PUT Member/subscription API.
   4. When API tries to upgrade user, it will check whether card is attached to this subscription or not. As card is not attached API will throw exception with error code 3201 and will return URL in data. This URL will be similar to :-
      https://www.123dapp.com/API/v1/member/view/updatecard?a=PA1ON1&b=4A153B37-C270-4D9D-A9CA-FA37683FE70F&c=BD88AD19EC25E6624EBD5DCAEC370970&productid=3&newproductid=4
   5. Now just use this URL in iframe. 
   6. So here you are not calling GET Member/updatecard API.

1. Client application calls the /login end point to begin login workflow  
2. The /login end point displays the login screen based on display criteria specified by the client  
3. Once end user has logged in the end point redirects back to the relative_redirect_path specified by the client application along with a login token  
4. The client application passes the token along with the login secret key to the /login/authenticatetoken end point to recieve a user session

This group of operations work on shops. A shop is a core entity in marketplace eco-system. A seller needs to establish a shop in order to start selling assets.

* A shop needs to be reviewed once it is created (requested). The Shop Approval Status indicates the review status and is initially set to PENDING following a shop creation. Once the review is complete, this field gets updated to either APPROVED or DENIED.
* The Shop Status field indicates whether the shop is online (i.e. visible to others) or offline. The DELETE operation can be utilized to bring a shop offline.

Update the asset of a shop.

+ Parameters
    + shop_id (required, Number, `20280723`)...Shop id

### Update shop asset [PUT]
The shop asset forSale flag can be set to either true or flag regardless of the Shop status. It is meant to reflect the seller's intent and is controlled by the seller of the shop.

Behind the scene: If the shop is OFFLINE, the assets are not going to show in the gallery and won't be available for purchase. If the shop is ONLINE, the assets are going to automatically show in the gallery when set for sale. Any change to the status of the shop (OFFLINE/ONLINE) triggers automatic update of the assets to hide/show them from the gallery.

**_Note:_** A physical asset cannot be put for sale without product fulfillment information.

## Cart line items [/carts/lineitems{?product_id,product_type,cart_type,quantity,unit_price,data,parent_id,line_item_id,hash_key,timestamp}]
Line items are items within carts. Cart can contain 'n' line items. User can perform various CRUD operations on line items.


### Update a cart line item [PUT]
Add a line item to the cart or update exisiting one of same type and product id. Return the updated tenant specific cart (as identified by afc header) for a member or guest session with lineItems, and total price. Additionally return the new/updated line item in the "updated" field. 
Here are some key points about cart:
* If a line item of type SUBSCRIPTION already exists in the cart this operation will result in a replace as no more than one subscription is allowed.
* LineItem will be added to the cart of the same type. <a href="/reference/appendices">ESTORE line item</a> will be added to ESTORE cart and MARKETPLACE line item will be added to MARKETPLACE cart. cart_type is not required in the call for ESTORE and MARKETPLACE.
* Cart type is required when adding an item to a cart of type MARKETPLACE_INSTANT since the cart type cannot be deduced from the product type.
* This call is not allowed to update the price on shipping line item.

### Update a shop asset [PUT]
Add / Update the shop asset.

Allow administrators to change the shop asset properties. The administrators canot change the for_sale flag of an asset since it reflects seller's intent.

If the shop is OFFLINE, the assets are not going to show in the gallery and won't be available for purchase. If the shop is ONLINE, the assets are going to automatically show in the gallery if the for_sale flag for this product is set to true. Any change to the status of the shop (OFFLINE/ONLINE) triggers automatic update of the assets to hide/show them from the gallery.
